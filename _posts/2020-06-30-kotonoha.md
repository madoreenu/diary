I had an English exam at my cram school today.

But It was stupid of me to choose the wrong classroom, and I solved problems for students of another grade!!! I thought they were quite difficult, but I worked hard.

I didn’t realize it until I had done..... So I have to go there again tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!

And I saw the movie “Kotonoha no Niwa”. I found it great. And I’m into the ending song now. I love Motohiro Hata’s cover! You should watch it!

I will buy the novelization!! I haven't been reading, so I am excited :)
