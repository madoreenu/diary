Recently, I came to like Ed Sheeran's old song one by one every day. When I woke up yesterday, Ed's song "Afire love" was playing in my head suddenly even though I didn't know the song's name!

Today I came to like a song named "Shirtsleeves".
It keeps playing in my head!

I love the part in which Ed pronounces "water" in British English.
I think it is one of the most beautiful part in this song!

## What I studied
- Classical Japanese
