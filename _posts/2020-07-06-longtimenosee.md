Finally, I could meet all my classmates last week.
And I had to wake up at six-thirty until this morning.
It makes me tired to be in all of the classes...

However, we pushed back the starting time of our school to nine-thirty from tomorrow!
I'm lucky. But I hope no more people get the virus.

And we changed the seating arrangement.
Now I can't see the blackboard well because I moved to a back seat :(

I'm writing an article about Jekyll on Qiita now.
I'll publish it tomorrow!
