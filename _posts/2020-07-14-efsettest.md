I talked with a Russian friend on Discord this morning.
He taught me about the "EF SET" test and his score.
The simple version of it took only 15 minutes so I tried to take it while breakfast.
There are 10 fill-in-the-blank and 10 listening questions.

But I didn't check the time limit, so I couldn't solve the problems all.
On top of that, the words are too difficult for me to understand.
So my score was so terrible...

Then I take a train to go to school, and I took the test again on it.
I did it seriously.
Luckily, the words were very easy and I could solve them all this time.

I got the best score :D
I can't believe this test now, so I'll try the 50 minutes version someday.
You can get a personalized "EF SET Certificate" with the 50 minutes one for FREE!!
Of course, you can write it on your resume and so on.
And you can check how many points you will get if you took TOEIC and TOEFL.

You should try it!!!!!!
I don't know why this test isn't famous in Japan.
