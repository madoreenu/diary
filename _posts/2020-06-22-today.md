I was inspired by Momiyama to make an English diary today, so I made this website.

I just found out [grammarly.com](https://grammarly.com) useful!
You should try using it.

I watched the first episode of Pokemon anime on Netflix, and it was fun.
I found the voice actors' voices haven't been changed ever!
Especially Kojiro.

Unfortunately, I have no time to study today!
...But I have to.

I will make some reports, then I will finish classical Japanese homework by tomorrow.

And I have to remember 600 English words by next month...
I don't like remembering words :(

I think I had better write down longer, but I can't do it with my poor vocabulary!
Good night.
