I couldn't join today's AtCoder contest because of my skin condition and so on...

I haven't joined two times in a row. I think this is the first time in my life.
I'm very frustrated with that.

But I could solve "Minesweeper", which had been so difficult for me!
I was delighted.
I believe that I can get back to normal!!!
