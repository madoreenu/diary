I was timed in the 50 meters race today!
I was so happy because the result which I got was not so bad even though I had thought I would get a bad result because of the quarantine.
I can run faster than I could a year ago.

And I helped my teacher bring a dead bug to a trash can...
I can't understand people who can't touch bugs XD

I had thought I had a Math test today, but I found it is tomorrow.
I will do my best :)
