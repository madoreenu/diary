I had my hair cut very short today.
Then I practiced "Say you won't let go" on the guitar, and I can play the whole part now! I think that is a great song.
And finally, my father bought me an iPad!

I can draw many pictures freely now.
I want to be able to draw complicated buildings, real fluffy animals, and people like anime.

But tomorrow is Monday, so of course, I have to go to school.

My friend will be surprised by my new hair, so I am a little excited.

This is my first iPad drawing‚Üì
