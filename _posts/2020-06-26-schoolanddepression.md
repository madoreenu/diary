Today, I didn't want to go to school but I didn't know why.
I went to school with a really bad feeling.

Then like I was rubbed salt in the wound, I had an important maths exam in my cram school today.
I didn't know about it until I hard it from my friend because I thought it was next week.

That was stupid of me.
I did my homework halfway.
I am a half-finished parson.

I don't want to do anything.
I won't be able to go to school from morning to evening.
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live now.
I am a half-finished parson.

I have to take a rest...
Today was an awful day.
