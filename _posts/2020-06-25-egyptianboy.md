I got full marks on my maths exam of drawing graphs. I was relieved.

Two Egyptian boys came into my discord server; one of them learns a lot of languages which include Japanese, and the other writes Python!

And I was taught physics by Momiyama today, so I understood how drawing graphs important. Thank you momee :)
I suck at physics and chemistry...

And I have to take geography and economy notes and practice the violin...
But I want to practice other instruments too, I want to draw stuff, I want to make a homemade web-shooting toy, and I want to sleep all day every day :(

I love days off. I promise nothing is more important than them.
But today is still Thursday. I will have to go to the cram school tomorrow.

## What I studied
- uniformly accelerated linear motion (Physics)
