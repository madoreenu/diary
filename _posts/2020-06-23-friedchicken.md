I had a home economics class today.
I didn't know the best way to squeeze lemon on fried chicken!
My teacher told us to turn a lemon peel downward on fried chicken when we squeeze it because lemon peels smell fruitier than its flesh!

Do you like to have fried chicken with lemons?
Actually, I prefer without them...

In the class, I couldn't read "柳葉魚". I was a little bit disappointed with myself. Can you read it?

And I learned how to draw cubic function graphs.
I'll have an exam about it tomorrow.

I had thought I had had an English class in my cram school today but I didn't have!
I was really happy, but I knew about a term-end exam next week... ;(

Arrrrrrgggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
Good night!

My friend Momiyama inspired me to make this diary.
I think he studies a lot every day, so if you want to learn something useful, I strongly recommend you to read HIS diary. Not mine.
