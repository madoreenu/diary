Thank God it's Saturday!

I slept a lot, drew, and played the ukulele for the first time in a while!

And I will have cut my hair and go shopping tomorrow.
I finally may be able to buy an iPad! XD
I really want to draw some pictures of fictitious places on an iPad with an apple pencil.

I still can't decide my next hairstyle, short or long.

Now I know how important taking rests is.

I think I had better practice more...
